19. Given two arrays. Arr1 = {1,2,3,8}, arr2 = {5,6,4,7}.
	Find a number from each array to be interchanged to reach a common sum of all elements for both arrays.
	Output: {1,5} or {3,7} or {2,6}

20. Design a car rental service application.

21. Infrastructure system design Problem Statement

	Design a scalable, reliable, and operable service which allows my customers to shorten URLs.
	That is, given an HTTP URL, it should return another URL based on a custom domain we have.
	When customers visit the shortened URL, it should redirect them back to the original URL.

	INPUT: http://portal.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000- 000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myvm1

	OUTPUT:http://foo.bar/$(key)

	The system should be able to handle 10 million (1007) new short URLs being generated each day,
	and 1 billion (1089) URLs being converted from short to long URLs each day.
	We would like to provide a p99 latency of 5 seconds for creating a short URL,
	and p99 latency of 200ms for converting a short URL back into its longer form.

	The system should retain URLs for 5 years and be able to tolerate failure of any single machine/rack/datacentre.
	The target user base is geographically limited to the United States and you do not need to design the system
	to support a globally distributed user base.

	If possible, please design the system without relying on off-the-shelf software components and services.

22. Implement a method (using streams) to find the top N frequent words from a given list of strings.
    Note: Ignore case and consider words separated by whitespace as separate words.

23. Calculate longest substring without repreating characters from a given String.

24. To promote physical fitness, on the portal they launched a "GetFit" tournament consisting of n sprints.
    Each sprint lasts for a given number of days and includes several tasks such as push-ups, running, etc.
    Some tasks are scheduled for each day of the sprint. The ith sprint lasts for days[i] days,
    and each sprint starts just after the other. That is, if the ith sprint ends on day d,
    the (i + 1)th sprint starts on day (d + 1). During each sprint, completing the required tasks scheduled
    on the jth day of the sprint earns the participant j points. The tournaments are periodic,
    i.e, as soon as the last sprint of a tournament ends, the first sprint of the next tournament begins.
    Each tournament, however, has the same schedule of sprints. More formally, the tournament schedule
    can be considered cyclic in nature and after the last sprint, the first sprint starts again.
    An employee decides to participate. However, due to a tight schedule, the employee cannot complete
    all tasks every day. Instead, the employee will complete the tasks of exactly k consecutive days,
    hoping to achieve the maximum number of points. Given the sprint days of n sprints, and the number of
    days for which the employee competes for k, find the maximum points the employee can score.
    The training can start and end on any day of any sprint.
    Note:
    • k is guaranteed to be less than the total number of days for which the sprints last.
    • Also, it is not necessary to start and end the training in the same tournament.
    • A sprint here denotes a set of activities performed in a particular time period.
    Example 1: There are n = 3 sprints, the number of days of each sprint are days = [2,3,2], and k=4.
    Explanation - The maximum number of points that can be attained = 2+1+2+3 = 8. One choice is to start on the last
    day of the first sprint and end on the last day of the second sprint.
    Example 2: days = [7,4,6,3,5] and k = 8, result = 33
    Explanation - A maximum of 33 points can be earned by starting on day 5 of sprint 4 and ending
    on the last day of sprint 5. The number of points earned is (5) + (1 + 2 + 3+ 4+ 5+ 6+7)=33. \
    Note how as soon as one set of sprint ends, the tournament again starts with the sprint of 7 days.

25. New Year's Day is around the corner and Amazon is having a sale.
    They have a list of items they are considering but they may need to remove some of them.
    Determine the minimum number of items to remove from an array of prices so that the sum of prices of any k items does not exceed a threshold.
    Note: If the number of items in the list is less than k, then there is no need to remove any more items.
    Example
    prices= [3, 2, 1, 4, 6, 5]
    k = 3
    threshold=14.
