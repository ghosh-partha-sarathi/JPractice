13. Task 2 (Cap India):
	String  s= "aaaabbbbef"
	Find the second non repeated character (f)

14. Task 3 (Cap India):
	There is a story in a file. Find out all words which doesnâ€™t have vowels.

15. Task 4 (BNY Mellon)
	Array 1: [1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6,1,1,1,1]		27
	Array 2: [3,4,5]
	Output: [24,20,0]

	// each value is a sum of items from Array 1 after we remove from it 3 smallest numbers (first value of Array 2),
	then 4 smallest (second value of Array 2), then 5 smallest numbers

Difference between synchronized colletion and Concurrent collection.
Sonarqube?

 Ex:
 Input : { "array", "apple", "rat"}
 Output: y,a,r

19. Given a string array, each element containing a line of apache log file. Every line starts with an IP address.
    Write a program that returns the IP address which appeared most of the times from the log file.

11. Given two arrays. Arr1 = {1,2,3,8}, arr2 = {5,6,4,7}.
	Find a number from each array to be interchanged to reach a common sum of all elements for both arrays.

12. Design a car rental service application.

13. Infrastructure system design Problem Statement

	Design a scalable, reliable, and operable service which allows my customers to shorten URLs.
	That is, given an HTTP URL, it should return another URL based on a custom domain we have.
	When customers visit the shortened URL, it should redirect them back to the original URL.

	INPUT: http://portal.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000- 000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myvm1

	OUTPUT:http://foo.bar/$(key)

	The system should be able to handle 10 million (1007) new short URLs being generated each day,
	and 1 billion (1089) URLs being converted from short to long URLs each day.
	We would like to provide a p99 latency of 5 seconds for creating a short URL,
	and p99 latency of 200ms for converting a short URL back into its longer form.

	The system should retain URLs for 5 years and be able to tolerate failure of any single machine/rack/datacentre.
	The target user base is geographically limited to the United States and you do not need to design the system
	to support a globally distributed user base.

	If possible, please design the system without relying on off-the-shelf software components and services.
