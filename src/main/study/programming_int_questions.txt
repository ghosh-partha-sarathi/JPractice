1. Calculate the sum of square of all odd numbers from a list of integers.
2. Generate a sequence of numbers from a given input number by adding previous n digits in the sequence (n being the number
   of integers in the input) untill the input number is reached.
   example: input 742
            sequence: 13, 19, 34, 66 .... 742
3. Write a program to merge two given sorted arrays so that the resultant array is also sorted.
   Example -
        Input: arr1=[1, 3, 5, 7], arr2=[2, 4, 6, 8]
        Output: arr3=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
4. Write a program to flatten a given array of numbers with nested array of numbers.
   The nesting could be upto n levels, where n is not known.
   Example -
        Input: inputArr=[1, 2, [3, [4, [5, 6]]], 7, [8, [9, [10]]]]
        Output: resultArr=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
5. Write a program to print all possible valid combinations of parentheses for a given
   number 'n' where 'n' represents number of parentheses in input.
   Example:
        Input: n = 3
        Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

        Input: n=2
        Output: ["(())", "()()"]


6. Write a program to print indexes of elements in a given array of integers whose sum
   equals given target number.
   Example:
        Input: nums = [1, 7, 11, 15,2], target = 9
        Output: [1, 4]
        Explanation: nums[1] + nums[4] = 7 + 2= 9, so the output is [1, 4].


7. A given array of integers represents day wise value of an item. Write a program to
   find the day on which if the item is sold the profit will be maximum.
   Example:
        Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6),
        profit = 6-1 = 5.
        Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed

8. Write a program to reverse all the words in a sentence.

9. Find sum of all checksums from a given list of integers after removing smallest
   and largest digits from each number.
   'Checksum' of a number is sum of all digits present in the number.
   Example:
   Explanation:

10. For given integer inputs N and P, find the prime index whose sum is greater than P.
    Example1:
        Input - N=8, P=9
        Output - 3
    Explanation:

    Example2:
        Input - N=10, P=20
        Output - 6
    Explanation:

    Example3:
        Input - N=15, P=35
        Output - 8
    Explanation:

11. Frog hopping problem.
    A frog is standing at the first index of an array where elements of array indicates
    maximum number of steps the frog can jump from that position. Find minimum hops required
    to reach the end of array.
    Example:
        Input: [2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1]
        Output: 3
    Explanation: index 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5

12. Write a program to spirally traverse and print elements of a n x n matrix.

13. Write a program to print maximum salary of each department from a list of Employee objects.
    Employee object consists of following fields-
    Employee Id - Integer
    Name        - String
    Department  - String
    Salary      - Integer
