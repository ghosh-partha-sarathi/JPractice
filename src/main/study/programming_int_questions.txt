1. Calculate the sum of square of all odd numbers from a list of integers.
2. Generate a sequence of numbers from a given input number by adding previous n digits in the sequence (n being the number
   of integers in the input) untill the input number is reached.
   example: input 742
            sequence: 13, 19, 34, 66 .... 742
3. Write a program to merge two given sorted arrays so that the resultant array is also sorted.
   Example -
        Input: arr1=[1, 3, 5, 7], arr2=[2, 4, 6, 8]
        Output: arr3=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
4. Write a program to flatten a given array of numbers with nested array of numbers.
   The nesting could be upto n levels, where n is not known.
   Example -
        Input: inputArr=[1, 2, [3, [4, [5, 6]]], 7, [8, [9, [10]]]]
        Output: resultArr=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
